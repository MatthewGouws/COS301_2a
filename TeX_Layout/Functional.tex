\section{Introduction}
The Computer Science Education Didactic and Application Research (CSEDAR) from the university of Pretoria. Have approached us in building a software platform to create a collaborative community by means of an online discussion. To aid students to excel in problem solving as  group. Such a tool already exists for students to use however this tool lacks certain functionality, Lecturer - Student interaction, often students are unaware of who is higher ranked in terms of the course (Teaching Assistant, Tutor, Lecturer \& student).

\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to present the clients requirements on a functional level by use of use-case diagrams, Domain models, pre- \& post conditions as well as possible input-output pairs.

\subsection{Document Conventions}
A ranking system of importance is used for the functional requirements based on a 'star' system with 
\\****** - Critical
\\*****  - Important
\\ ****  - Somewhat important
\\  ***  - Nice to have
\\  **   - Not considered


\subsection{Project Scope}
The scope of this project is to create a Buzz Space system to integrate into the Computer Science Department's website at the University of Pretoria. This software solution will provide an online forum that is both organized and interactive to engage the students in their studies. The project can then later also be expanded to multiple universities and institutions.

\subsection{References}

\section{System Description}
Buzz will be a complete software unit which is to be integrated seamlessly with existing web servers to be used by courses to encourage the use of online discussion. Users will be able to climb ranks up the online discussion forum and achieve more functionality as they progress. The system will also have certain functionality incorporated into awarding users marks if required so by the teaching staff. Teaching staff will also be able to archive and summarise threads. Users will also only be able to post in threads which pertain to them at that specific time, thus having a thread become 'Ancient' and hence archived no new information may be added to said thread.

\subsubsection{Use Case Prioritization}
\textbf{Critical:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Users must be able to create, Read, update and delete posts.
\item Users must only be able to post on specific threads/levels based on their level.
\item Staff should be able to summarize, close/hide threads and move posts around.
\item Buzz must integrate seamlessly with any host site.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Important:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should keep track of what posts have been read by a specific user and highlight unread posts.
\item The system should allow for social tagging, allowing users to easily locate threads on what they are looking for.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Important-Nice to have:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The post length should be restricted. Users of higher levels can post and embed Pictures, Videos etc.
\item A users status should automatically update based on their participation.
\item Post should be able to be up-voted, shown higher in the thread.
\item Statistics should be available for each student displaying their marks, and visual reporting of their level.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\textbf{Nice to have:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Semi-automated thread summary creation.
\item Create an automated template based on Message and other users.
\item Provide searching and filtering.
\item Enhancement of posts, such as Rich-text-format editor.
\item Apply organization of content based on tags, base structure or ownership structure.
\item Detect if a post is plagiarised.
\item Detect if Netiquette rule are broken.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Required Functionality}
The Following system processes detail the functional requirements of the individual points.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users must create, Update and delete posts. % Point 1 - Syzmon
  	\begin{enumerate}
  		\item Create Post
  		\begin{enumerate}
    		\item Elaboration - In order for the user to communicate with others in the Buzz space, (s)he need to be able to 				create posts. User must have sufficient permissions to post in certain areas of the Buzz space. This function is not available to guests.
   	 		\item Importance - *****, Critical
   	 		\item Dependency level - With out the ability to create posts users will not be able to communicate with one another, which makes the Buzz space useless.
   	 		\item Pre-conditions
   			\begin{enumerate}
    			\item User must have necessary permissions.
    			\item Buzz space must exist.
    			\item User must be registered.
    			\item User must be logged in and not a guest.
    		\end{enumerate}
     		\item Post-conditions
    		\begin{enumerate}
  	  			\item Post will be successfully created.
   	 		\end{enumerate}
   	 		\item Requester - Client
  		\end{enumerate}

  	\clearpage
  	\newpage
  		\item Read Post
  		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item Elaboration - This function allows users read posts made by other users of the Buzz space.
   	 		\item Importance - *****, Critical
   	 		\item Dependency level - This function is very important because without it, the Buzz space is useless as users will not be able to read each others posts, which defeats the purpose of the Buzz space.
   	 		\item Pre-conditions
   			\begin{enumerate}
    			\item Buzz space and post must exist.
    			\item Access to Buzz space.
    		\end{enumerate}
     		\item Post-conditions
    		\begin{enumerate}
  	  			\item If the user is not a guest post will be marked as read.
   	 		\end{enumerate}
   	 		\item Requester - Client
  		\end{enumerate}

  	\end{figure}
  	\newpage
  	\clearpage
  		\item Update Post
  		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item Elaboration - This function allows the user to update his/her post. It is only available to certain users such as the owner of the post or the moderators.
   	 		\item Importance - *****, Critical
   	 		\item Dependency level - Updating posts is another important process needed in the Buzz space. People often make mistakes in their posts and have to correct it. The ability to update the post will help achieve that.
   	 		\item Pre-conditions
   			\begin{enumerate}
    			\item User must be either the owner of the post or the moderator of that Buzz space.
    		\end{enumerate}
     		\item Post-conditions
    		\begin{enumerate}
  	  			\item Post will be updated.
   	 		\end{enumerate}
   	 		\item Requester - Client
  		\end{enumerate}

  	\end{figure}
  	\clearpage
  	\newpage
  		\item Delete Post
  		\begin{enumerate}
  			\item Elaboration - Deleting posts allows for users to remove their post from a Buzz space and also allows the moderators to delete posts that they think are not suitable for the Buzz space.
   	 		\item Importance - *****, Critical
   	 		\item Dependency level - The deleting of a post is also very important to a Buzz space. Owners of a post would like to remove their post if they think it is not relevant to the topic and moderators should be able to delete user posts if they think the post is not relevant.
   	 		\item Pre-conditions
   			\begin{enumerate}
    			\item User must be either the owner of the post or the moderator of that Buzz space.
    			\item Post must exist.
    		\end{enumerate}
     		\item Post-conditions
    		\begin{enumerate}
  	  			\item Post will be marked as deleted and hidden from Buzz space. Post is not physically deleted from database.
   	 		\end{enumerate}
   	 		\item Requester - Client

\clearpage %Each point on a new page
  \item Keep track of who has read what and highlight unread messages for each user. % Point 2 - Rendani
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - This process will allow the student/user to see which thread he/she still has to read by applying some form of emphasis on the thread. It will also allow a lecturer/board moderator to view read statistics of a thread such as how many students have read a thread and who those students are.
    \item Importance - ****
    \item Dependency level - Highlighting unread posts is important because it will allow users to efficiently follow discussions without having to find specific points where they last read and this in turn will help users post replies faster keeping discussions relevant. It is also important that the lecturer/moderator can view statistics of who has read which posts as this will give them an idea of how many students follow discussions and who those students are.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item A user must be logged in and registered for that particular buzz space.
    	\item A user must be logged in and have elevated privileges, such as lecturer/moderator status, to view read statistics of a post
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User is presented with formatted view highlighting unread threads
    	\item User(lecturer) is presented with read statistics of a particular thread

\clearpage %Each point on a new page
  \item Restrict the length of messages and the type of content allowed in messages based
on the level where it is posted as well as on the status of the user posting the
message.  % Point 3 - David
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - Restrictions on the length of message should be configurable by policy, according to user level and post location. This will allow Buzz Space creators specific control over content type and post length for users of different level/rank.
    \item Importance - ***
    \item Dependency level - Relies on the ranking system to be implemented and provide a user's level/rank. Two policies must be set by the Buzz Space creator, one for message length according to level/rank, and one for permitted content types according to level/rank.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User must belong to a Buzz Space.
    	\item User must attempt to post.
	\item Policies must be acquired.
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User successfully posted a post that contains only permitted content types.
    	\item User successfully posted a post that contains less than or equal to the permitted character length.
    \end{enumerate}

\clearpage %Each point on a new page
   \item Restrict users to post on specified levels based on their status. % Point 4 - Roger
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - User interaction with the current Buzz space must be configurable by policy to allow users with higher levels to post to the Buzz space on higher levels such as directly below the main post while restricting low level users to only post in lower levels like sub level posts or even sub sub level posts. This allows high level users to post higher up in the Buzz spaces hierarchy while restricting low level users to the bottom. 
    \item Importance - ****
    \item Dependency level - Relies on the ranking system to be implemented so that it can request user levels. A policy to govern the levels has to be supplied by the creator of the Buzz space.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User must be part of the specific Buzz space.
    	\item Policy acquired.
    	\item User must try to post.
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User successfully posted to the correct level as specified in the policy.

   \item  Allow staff to manage content i.e. summarise, close or hide threads and move things around.% Point 5 - Ivan
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - After a staff member has viewed through the thread he can choose to add a summary of what the thread is about. He can then close the thread to stop further posts but still visible to other members or hide the thread to make it only visible to selected members.
    \item Importance - ****.
    \item Dependency level - Relies on the user having the rights or high enough rank/owner of the thread.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item The user has a high enough rank.
    	\item The user is the owner of the thread.

   \item  Provide functionality to support semi-automatic creation of thread summaries% Point 6 - Keagan
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration – After an allocated user has gone through a thread, selecting the posts that are important enough to be added into the thread summary, the System must process the thread and create the summary using the relevant posts. 
    \item Importance - ***
    \item Dependency level – Relies on the ability to give staff/privileged users the ability to edit threads. It also needs the ranking system as well as a policy governing user levels to be available to it.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User must be given the privileges required to view the thread at a higher level and select/unselect posts for inclusion/exclusion in the summary
    	\item Allocated user must submit thread for summarizing to be done by the System
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User successfully selected the posts that need to be included in the summary and submitted the thread for summarizing
    	\item System processed the thread posts and created one summary of the thread

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - This generates a template message about a topic to an individual user or a group.
    \item Importance - ***
    \item Dependency level - This depends on the user input; the system will parse through the user input and build a summary accordingly
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
 		\item Condition 1 - Users have to be connected to buzz either logged in or guest account to get automated messages.
    	\item Condition 2 - Group must exist and have at least one member.

   \item Apply self-organasation based on social tagging and allow the user to view according to the base structure, own structure or public structure % Point 15 - Neo
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - The user is able to use social tags that tell us more about a post thus is also able to search for a thread according to topics that have those social tags and arrange topic threads accordingly via tags. The user is also able to view posts according to the base structure given by the buzz system or specify their own structure by making use of the social tags there is also a general structure for the public who are not registered users. 
    \item Importance - ***
    \item Dependency level - This feature depends on the user selecting tags in which to order the base structure of the posts that they see.
    \item Pre-conditions
