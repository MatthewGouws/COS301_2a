\section{Introduction}
The Computer Science Education Didactic and Application Research (CSEDAR) from the university of Pretoria. Have approached us in building a software platform to create a collaborative community by means of an online discussion. To aid students to excel in problem solving as  group. Such a tool already exists for students to use however this tool lacks certain functionality, Lecturer - Student interaction, often students are unaware of who is higher ranked in terms of the course (Teaching Assistant, Tutor, Lecturer \& student).

\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to present the clients requirements on a functional level by use of use-case diagrams, Domain models, pre- \& post conditions as well as possible input-output pairs.

\subsection{Document Conventions}
A ranking system of importance is used for the functional requirements based on a 'star' system with 
\\****** - Critical
\\*****  - Important
\\ ****  - Somewhat important
\\  ***  - Nice to have
\\  **   - Not considered


\subsection{Project Scope}
Short overview with limitations and restrictions of the project.

\section{System Description}
Buzz will be a complete software unit which is to be integrated seamlessly with existing web servers to be used by courses to encourage the use of online discussion. Users will be able to climb ranks up the online discussion forum and achieve more functionality as they progress. The system will also have certain functionality incorporated into awarding users marks if required so by the teaching staff. Teaching staff will also be able to archive and summarise threads. Users will also only be able to post in threads which pertain to them at that specific time, thus having a thread become 'Ancient' and hence archived no new information may be added to said thread.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Use Cases}
We can Add all the details from MagicDraw here

\subsubsection{Use Case Prioritization}
\textbf{Critical:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Users must be able to create, Read, update and delete posts.
\item Users must only be able to post on specific threads/levels based on their level.
\item Staff should be able to summarize, close/hide threads and move posts around.
\item Buzz must integrate seamlessly with any host site.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Important:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should keep track of what posts have been read by a specific user and highlight unread posts.
\item The system should allow for social tagging, allowing users to easily locate threads on what they are looking for.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Important-Nice to have:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The post length should be restricted. Users of higher levels can post and embed Pictures, Videos etc.
\item A users status should automatically update based on their participation.
\item Post should be able to be up-voted, shown higher in the thread.
\item Statistics should be available for each student displaying their marks, and visual reporting of their level.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\textbf{Nice to have:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Semi-automated thread summary creation.
\item Create an automated template based on Message and other users.
\item Provide searching and filtering.
\item Enhancement of posts, such as Rich-text-format editor.
\item Apply organization of content based on tags, base structure or ownership structure.
\item Detect if a post is plagiarised.
\item Detect if Netiquette rule are broken.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Required Functionality}
The Following system processes detail the functional requirements of the individual points.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Users must create, Update and delete posts. % Point 1 - Syzmon
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - 
    \item Importance - *****
    \item Dependency level - 
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Condition 1
    	\item Condition 2
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Condition 1
    	\item Condition 2
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Requester
  \end{enumerate}
%Diagram to go here \includegraphics[width=350px]{UseCases/File_Name.png}
\newpage %Each point on a new page
  \item Keep track of who has read what and highlight unread messages for each user. % Point 2 - Rendani
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - This process will allow the student/user to see which thread he/she still has to read by applying some form of emphasis on the thread. It will also allow a lecturer/board moderator to view read statistics of a thread such as how many students have read a thread and who those students are.
    \item Importance - *
    \item Dependency level - This function is not critical to the core operation of the system but is a client requested amenity. 
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item A user must be logged in and registered for that particular buzz space.
    	\item A user must be logged in and have elevated privileges, such as lecturer/moderator status, to view read statistics of a post
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User is presented with formatted view highlighting unread threads
    	\item User(lecturer) is presented with read statistics of a particular thread
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Requester - Client
  \end{enumerate}
	%\includegraphics[width=350px]{"Diagrams/Use Case/Dau use case 1".png}
\newpage %Each point on a new page
  \item Restrict the length of messages and the type of content allowed in messages based
on the level where it is posted as well as on the status of the user posting the
message.  % Point 3 - David
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - Restrictions on the length of message should be configurable by policy, according to user level and post location. This will allow Buzz Space creators specific control over content type and post length for users of different level/rank.
    \item Importance - ***
    \item Dependency level - Relies on the ranking system to be implemented and provide a user's level/rank. Two policies must be set by the Buzz Space creator, one for message length according to level/rank, and one for permitted content types according to level/rank.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User must belong to a Buzz Space.
    	\item User must attempt to post.
	\item Policies must be acquired.
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User successfully posted a post that contains only permitted content types.
    	\item User successfully posted a post that contains less than or equal to the permitted character length.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Requester - System
  \end{enumerate}

%Diagram to go here \includegraphics[width=350px]{UseCases/File_Name.png}
\newpage %Each point on a new page
   \item Restrict users to post on specified levels based on their status. % Point 4 - Roger
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Elaboration - User interaction with the current Buzz space must be configurable by policy to allow users with higher levels to post to the Buzz space on higher levels such as directly below the main post while restricting low level users to only post in lower levels like sub level posts or even sub sub level posts. This allows high level users to post higher up in the Buzz spaces hierarchy while restricting low level users to the bottom. 
    \item Importance - ****
    \item Dependency level - Relies on the ranking system to be implemented so that it can request user levels. A policy to govern the levels has to be supplied by the creator of the Buzz space.
    \item Pre-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User must be part of the specific Buzz space.
    	\item Policy acquired.
    	\item User must try to post.
    \end{enumerate}
        \item Post-conditions
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item User successfully posted to the correct level as specified in the policy.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Requester - System (This is an automated system requirement)
